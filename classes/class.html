<!-- In 2015, JavaScript introduced the concept of the Class.

Classes and Objects in JavaScript coding can be created similar to any other Object-Oriented language. 

Classes can also have methods performing different logic using the class properties respectively. 

The new feature like Class and Inheritance eases the development and work with Classes in the application. 

JavaScript is an object-based language based on prototypes and allows to create hierarchies of objects and to have inheritance of properties and their values.

The Class syntax is built on top of the existing prototype-based inheritance model. -->
