<!-- Exception handling is accomplished with a try...catch statement. When the program encounters an exception, the program will terminate in an unfriendly manner. To protect against this, the code can be placed in a try...catch statement and avoid terminating the program unexpectedly. 

Try statements: It lets the developer validate a block of code whether it will result in some errors or not. 
Catch statements: It lets the developer handle the error without terminating the program in an unfriendly manner. 
Throw statements: It helps the developer to create custom errors. 
Finally statements: It lets the developer execute code, after the try and catch block execution, irrespective of the result.  -->

<!-- Here, num2 is 0 so when you try to divide num1 by num2 it will throw Divide by zero error. Also, finally()
 is called whenever an error occurs. So as a result, two statements will be printed: "Divide by zero" and "Some error occurred".  -->
