// Over the past few years, security incidents have increased finding ways to attack resources through applications,
// particularly web-based applications accessible over the internet. Hence, the security of an application has become an essential feature.
// This is specifically true with one of the most adaptable and flexible languages used to spread out functionality in websites 
//i.e. JavaScript. As you know JavaScript is an incredibly powerful language and it is everywhere now.

// However, JavaScript has several security issues since its release, which has gained outspread attention. 
//Because it allows executable content to be embedded in static web pages. Also, the loading of these web pages can cause harmful code
// to be executed on the client-side.

// Also, JavaScript interaction with DOM (Document Object Model) causes risk for end users by enabling damaging actors to deliver scripts
// over the web and run them on client machines.

// Hence, stringent security precautions to be taken to prevent malicious code from causing any damage to data and privacy.

// JavaScript security refers to the security measures that every JavaScript developer should follow while developing web applications. 
//JavaScript security encompasses measures to be practiced in improving web application safety by identifying and preventing the weaknesses in the application.

// As you know that JavaScript is the most popular language used for web application development and the way JavaScript interacts with 
//DOM(Document Object Model) causes a lot of risk for end-users, by allowing attackers to get into the code easily by finding the vulnerable component in the application.

// Also, JavaScript can be executed outside the browser through the Node.js platform (runtime environment for developing server-side of 
//the application) makes it more important to implement security features in JavaScript applications.

// There are many JavaScript-based frameworks available now which provide access to the native system APIs, which offers a lot of 
//flexibility to JavaScript developers, and on the other hand, this makes JavaScript vulnerable to different types of attacks.
// Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application in the absence of safe coding practices in the application.

// Hence, by following the security measures you can write secure JavaScript code.
