// The core aim of an XSS attack is to execute wicked JavaScript in the victim's browser. The hacker or the attacker can execute this goal in diverse ways. It is essential to recognize the diverse ways the attacker supplements code into the application so that the developer can implement safe and secure coding practices.

// There are mainly three types of XSS attacks:

// DOM-based XSS - Javascript dynamically includes the malicious script provided by the user on the web page results in a DOM XSS attack.

// Reflected XSS - The user-provided input is rendered back in the output without validation/verification.

// Persistent XSS - The user-provided input is stored by the application that is viewed at a later time by another user. 
                    // Stored XSS is often considered a high or critical risk as it impacts more users.

//  Let us understand these types of attacks in detail.
