// if required, BOM also gives a specific object to target only one of the window properties. For example, if the concern is about the list of URLs that have been visited by the user and there is no need for any other information about the browser, BOM gives the 'history' object for this. It provides programmatic navigation to one of the URLs previously visited by the user. Following are the properties or methods that helps in doing so. 

// Property:

// back() method, loads previous URL from history list. Usage: history.back(); 

// forward() method, loads next URL from history list. Usage: history.forward(); 

// go() method, loads previous URL present  at the  given number from the history list.
