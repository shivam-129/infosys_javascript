// As you know that, JavaScript is capable of dynamically manipulating the content and style of HTML elements of the web page currently 
//rendered on the browser. The content given for para during HTML creation or the style given for heading during HTML creation can be
/ changed even after the page has arrived on the browser. 

// This dynamic manipulation of an HTML page on the client-side itself is achieved with the help of built-in browser objects. 
//They allow JavaScript code to programmatically control the browser and are collectively known as Browser Object Model (BOM). 

// For programming purposes, the BOM model virtually splits the browser into different parts and refers to each part as a different type 
//of built-in object. BOM is a hierarchy of multiple objects. 'window' object is the root object and consists of other objects in a 
//hierarchy, such as, 
// 1. 'history' object, 
// 2. 'navigator' object, 
// 3. 'location' object
// 4. 'document' object.
// window.history
// window.document
// window.location
// window.navigator
